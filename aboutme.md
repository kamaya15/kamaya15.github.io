My research focuses on the neural circuits that underlie reward learning, motivation, and action. I am a recipient of the NIH D-SPAN F99/K00 award and was previously on an NSF GRFP.

### my history

I graduated in 2015 from Dartmouth College with a B.A. in Neuroscience with honors, and won the Nickerson award for my senior honors thesis.
